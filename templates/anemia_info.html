        <h1>Anemia Information</h1>
        <p>Anemia occurs when you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues. Here's what you need to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Causes of Anemia:</strong> Anemia can be caused by various factors including iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency (such as B12 or folate), chronic diseases, genetic conditions, and certain medications.</li>
            <li><strong>Symptoms of Anemia:</strong> Common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, pale or yellowish skin, cold hands and feet, and chest pain.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment Options:</strong> Treatment for anemia depends on the underlying cause. It may include dietary changes, iron or vitamin supplements, medications to stimulate red blood cell production, or procedures to address underlying conditions.</li>
            <li class="tip"><strong>Home Remedies:</strong> In addition to medical treatment, some home remedies may help alleviate symptoms and support overall health. Consider incorporating iron-rich foods like spinach, beans, red meat, and fortified cereals into your diet. Vitamin C can enhance iron absorption, so include foods like oranges, strawberries, and bell peppers. Avoid excessive caffeine consumption, as it can inhibit iron absorption.</li>
            <li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> If you suspect you have anemia or experience symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and personalized treatment. Your doctor may recommend blood tests to determine the cause and severity of anemia, and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs.</li>
        </ul>
